## Hiya there! 🤠🦧
I'm Nicoh, a Data Scientist based in Southern California & New York City. 

I design things that I find cool or that will teach me things. 

I prioritize efficiency, but when I first look at a data set I explore! 

I mainly use R in RStudio but sometimes I play around with Python and SQL. 

I like AI and I like video games. So I spend free time building machine learning models for the games I like. I've also dabbled around with LLMs and NLPs. 
Sometimes I play around with Deepseek R1 which I downloaded with Ollama and Docker to set up a Locally hosted website with the LLM. 

I love apes. My favorite is the orangutan, although humans are cool too. 
I go to school @ Columbia University.
